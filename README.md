Social networks have lots of problems, but sometimes it's nice to be able to send out small status updates, and we already have a mechanism for that: rss.

rss supports wide distribution, but doesn't support things like: avatars, favorites, comments, or even replies. It's perfect for getting your thoughts out into the world without trying to farm social clout. It's also compatible with just about any news reader.

It's like a blog, but simpler.

pythonrss-simple.py expects you to already have the skeleton of an rss file started. When you run it, it asks you for the entry title and the content of the update. 

Then it updates the rss feed and that's it. Whoever you've convinced to check your social.rss file will get your pithy updates the next time their feed readers update.
